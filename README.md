# Pixels

Pixels is a project made in NextJS and TailwindCSS which runs on the client side **mostly**. I got the idea to create it after seeing [this website](https://pixelate-me.vercel.app/) and there was no code / github link as it is **closed source**. So I thought why not to create it. 

Now **you may thiik that nextjs does server side rendering so how did I make this client side application?** Well for this as nextjs has `"use client"` I used it and there is also a  [github repository](https://github.com/t3dotgg/quickpic) which I used up a bit for reference as it does some thing similar to this project.

I have used the [3d card component](https://github.com/Hackclub-OC/pixels/blob/main/components/3d-card.tsx) from a UI Library called [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/) to save some time and effort.

**Have fun pixelating! your images**


**For high seas fraud team**

Below is the message about this project for the high seas fraud team. After my conversation with Hubert as he told me that the payout and hours count for my ship was reduced I did no research or didn't think about it. Then suddenly today was looking in the payout of this project and find out that 23 hours of time has been reduced because I was able to make an update for the same amount of time. Next the payout I got meant that it is for 11 hours of work for which at first I got 10 votes (full payout with 20% pirate's blessing and later with 10 % bonus which I got after the first update. What it meant is that for 11 hours of my work I got 172 doubloons instead of a lot more. Because I have worked more like 30 hours or more on this project (the time is what got spent in figma, and vs code alone) and 172 means like 15 doubloons per hour of my work which is very less (as the original payout will be like 30.8 doubloons per hour). 

I have more explanations to give so direct message me for it.
